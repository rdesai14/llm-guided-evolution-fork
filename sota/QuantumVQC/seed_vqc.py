"""
Base seed algorithm: a variational quantum classifier in Qiskit.

This is individual zero. Evolution mutates the blocks below the first
OPTION marker (see the separators further down); everything above it is fixed
scaffolding and is never handed to the LLM.

Contract with the LLM-GE harness:
  python seed_vqc.py --gene-id <id> --out-dir <dir>
writes "<obj1>, <obj2>" to <out_dir>/<gene_id>_results.txt, matching
run_improved.py check4results(). Both objectives are MINIMIZED:
  obj1 = 1 - validation accuracy, averaged over N_STARTS trainings
  obj2 = gate count
A crash, an invalid circuit, or a missing file leaves the harness to assign
INVALID_FITNESS_MAX, which is the intended failure path - do not catch broadly
and report a fake score.

Fitness is computed on VALIDATION. Every circuit is also scored on test right after
training, like ExquisiteNetV2 does, but test only goes into <gene>_metrics.json.
